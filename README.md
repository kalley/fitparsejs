fitparsejs
==========

Extremely experimental at this point, and as of now, almost completely ported from [GoldenCheetah](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah) (minus a few of their classes).

Only prints everything to `sdout` so far, but it's coming along pretty nicely.

You can use it in your own app with `fitparse = require('fitparse').fitFileReader` or you can run it from the command line:

    fitparsejs -f /path/to/file.fit

More to come, especially after I get a chance to wrap my head around ANT's FIT SDK.
